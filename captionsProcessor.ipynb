      "INFO:root:Relevant text selected for Topic - Educational Assessment Design: I'm going to show them and explain them to you here, but I'm going to also go ahead and demo so you know how to set those up and how to use those user experience from the instructor's perspective. And users, user experience from the student's perspective, as well as some moderation features. New quizzes is fun and exciting. There's a lot of new things to learn. Some things are made more simplistic, but I will also share with you if, if there's any caveats of any of that. So over on the left side, you'll see, so as new question types, the first question type you see is something we call stimulus. And when I demonstrate that I'll go more into it. But what a stimulus is, an essence. You can take a passage from a reading or document and you can build questions from that stimulus questions. So if I click on this just briefly to show you a preview before we get to the actual questions in Canvas. Here's a sample paragraph, and you'll see on the right-hand side, you can build questions based upon the passage reading. So they can be multiple choice, true and false. Of these can be a part of the stimulus question. So the passage or the reading is on the left. And then you can build out different question types on the right. Again, multiple choice, fill in the blank, true or false. Hotspot, anything that you would want, and we'll sample that a little bit later. Then we have what's called hotspot question. I, one of my favorites, however, you're going to hear me say this twice. It is not assessable. However, that is the caveat for the hotspot question. A hotspot question is where you can highlight a particular area for the student to answer. Like if you sit highlight Grand Rapids, you'll see in this particular example that it looks like a little blue box around that, That's considered the hot-spot area. Again, I'm just giving you high level right now because we're going to go a lot deeper a little bit later. Then we have the ordering questions. You can put things in specific order. So if I'm asking you to look at it from a linear perspective or if I'm saying organize the dates, you can order those as, as needed. And then last but not least, as far as the new quiz question type, you have a categorization where you can put things into categories. This is very similar to some of what you might have seen before, but with categorization, There's a couple of new things that you can include with this as well. For instance, there is an area, and I'll describe this a little bit. If you want to say categorize furniture versus food, you can put a list of items that are furniture like a chair and table that you can do food like, I don't know, pizza and brownies. And then you can throw in another question that doesn't go into either set. And I'll talk about what that looks like and what that means for you as the person's setting this up in the student, taking it and some of the things that you should say. So you didn't really tricking the students. So those are the four new question type. So I'm gonna go over in this class. Let's talk about the user experience. So as far as if from an instructor's perspective, you have the ability to shuffle not just the answers, but also shuffle the questions per the quiz. There's a couple of ways you can do this, and you can do it from the main settings as well as per question depending on the question type and how that looks. Another thing that you can do is have the ability to print quizzes for manually grading. So what this means is that even though it's an online course, let's say you may still want the ability to be able to print those out, and you can do so here in New Quizzes. Then we have instructors can duplicate a question when creating a quiz. I don't know about you, but this is something that I do a lot of practicing as you can imagine in Canvas because I'm trying to break it so I can repair it, so to speak. So they have easy way to just duplicate a question without having to redo the entire question. Maybe there's a part a to the question and maybe I want a follow-up a part B. So some of it's similar or has some of the same answers, I can just duplicate that. And we also have quiz an item analysis tables that I won't be going over in this class. I can touch on it very, very briefly, but in essence, it's a way to analyze data. And again, there is another class that touches on this a little bit more, but it can analyze the class. And you would have to set this up so that when you're looking at grades, if you already have the grades, you can analyze the mean score, the medium scores as well. Not just in the class, but actually on the quiz question type. I should say that last but not least, you can build out settings or reports and moderation for each of these question types and what that looks like within the course. So I'm going to take a pause before I go on to user experience for students, any questions, anything that I did not go over that you would like to see? As of yet. I should say. If there's no questions, I'm gonna go ahead and continue. User experience from the student's perspective. You have the ability for students to what we referred to as pin questions. So a student is working, let's say a ten question exam. 20 question exam doesn't really matter. And they're stumped on the one question. They're not sure, but they want to come back to it. They can pin the question. And so that they can move on, especially if it's a time test. If they pin the question. At that point, you'll be able to come back to that question. It will also alert the student that they do have a pin question that they need to. So upon submission, it'll say you've pin that one question. You may want to go back to her. Another thing, on-screen calculators are an option now, this is mainly for math and science courses, but maybe you want to use them in other courses as well. You'll have an option. You can pin the calculator at the top of every quiz. So your students have access to that quiz calculator if they need it. Moving on, you have the ability to print quizzes, to have a hard copy. Basically, what I had said over here for the faculty as well, that you're able to manually print for it if you need a hard copy. Then scrolling timer. So if you want, you can put a scrolling timer on a particular quiz. I remember when I was in school though, it was a little frustrating to see that I only have 6 min left. I wouldn't want to see that, but you can add a tiny timer on it so you can see how much time is remaining for time test. It is an option.\n",

Again, multiple choice, fill in the blank, true or false. Hotspot, anything that you would want, and we'll sample that a little bit later. Then we have what's called hotspot question. I, one of my favorites, however, you're going to hear me say this twice. It is not assessable. However, that is the caveat for the hotspot question. A hotspot question is where you can highlight a particular area for the student to answer. Like if you sit highlight Grand Rapids, you'll see in this particular example that it looks like a little blue box around that, That's considered the hot-spot area. Again, I'm just giving you high level right now because we're going to go a lot deeper a little bit later. Then we have the ordering questions. You can put things in specific order. So if I'm asking you to look at it from a linear perspective or if I'm saying organize the dates, you can order those as, as needed. And then last but not least, as far as the new quiz question type, you have a categorization where you can put things into categories. This is very similar to some of what you might have seen before, but with categorization, There's a couple of new things that you can include with this as well. For instance, there is an area, and I'll describe this a little bit. If you want to say categorize furniture versus food, you can put a list of items that are furniture like a chair and table that you can do food like, I don't know, pizza and brownies. And then you can throw in another question that doesn't go into either set. And I'll talk about what that looks like and what that means for you as the person's setting this up in the student, taking it and some of the things that you should say. So you didn't really tricking the students. So those are the four new question type. So I'm gonna go over in this class. Let's talk about the user experience. So as far as if from an instructor's perspective, you have the ability to shuffle not just the answers, but also shuffle the questions per the quiz. There's a couple of ways you can do this, and you can do it from the main settings as well as per question depending on the question type and how that looks. Another thing that you can do is have the ability to print quizzes for manually grading. So what this means is that even though it's an online course, let's say you may still want the ability to be able to print those out, and you can do so here in New Quizzes. Then we have instructors can duplicate a question when creating a quiz. I don't know about you, but this is something that I do a lot of practicing as you can imagine in Canvas because I'm trying to break it so I can repair it, so to speak. So they have easy way to just duplicate a question without having to redo the entire question. Maybe there's a part a to the question and maybe I want a follow-up a part B. So some of it's similar or has some of the same answers, I can just duplicate that. And we also have quiz an item analysis tables that I won't be going over in this class. I can touch on it very, very briefly, but in essence, it's a way to analyze data. And again, there is another class that touches on this a little bit more, but it can analyze the class. And you would have to set this up so that when you're looking at grades, if you already have the grades, you can analyze the mean score, the medium scores as well. Not just in the class, but actually on the quiz question type. I should say that last but not least, you can build out settings or reports and moderation for each of these question types and what that looks like within the course. So I'm going to take a pause before I go on to user experience for students, any questions, anything that I did not go over that you would like to see? As of yet. I should say. If there's no questions, I'm gonna go ahead and continue. User experience from the student's perspective. You have the ability for students to what we referred to as pin questions. So a student is working, let's say a ten question exam. 20 question exam doesn't really matter. And they're stumped on the one question. They're not sure, but they want to come back to it. They can pin the question. And so that they can move on, especially if it's a time test. If they pin the question. At that point, you'll be able to come back to that question. It will also alert the student that they do have a pin question that they need to. So upon submission, it'll say you've pin that one question. You may want to go back to her. Another thing, on-screen calculators are an option now, this is mainly for math and science courses, but maybe you want to use them in other courses as well. You'll have an option. You can pin the calculator at the top of every quiz. So your students have access to that quiz calculator if they need it. Moving on, you have the ability to print quizzes, to have a hard copy. Basically, what I had said over here for the faculty as well, that you're able to manually print for it if you need a hard copy. Then scrolling timer. So if you want, you can put a scrolling timer on a particular quiz. I remember when I was in school though, it was a little frustrating to see that I only have 6 min left. I wouldn't want to see that, but you can add a tiny timer on it so you can see how much time is remaining for time test. It is an option.\n",
      "There should be four possible answers, with one being the correct answers. Also Provide a short reason to why each answer is correct or incorrect.\n",
      "Return the data in the following JSON format as an example: {\"question\": \"What is the capital of France?\", \"answers\": [\"Paris\", \"London\", \"Berlin\", \"Madrid\"], \"correct\": \"Paris\", \"reason\": \"Paris is the capital of France\"}\n",
      "INFO:root:Time range for relevant text for Topic - Quiz Points Configuration Guidance: 00:40:45 to 01:03:08\n",
      "INFO:root:Relevant text selected for Topic - Quiz Points Configuration Guidance: I'm going to take a thoughtful pause. I have a couple of questions. Okay? So as far as the points go, so when you create a quiz, the default points per question is one. Is that right? Yes. So if I make the quiz, Let's say it's worth 140 points. And I leave the, each question at one, then it's going to distribute. We're going to calculate what the points are per each question without me having to enter them individually. Well, so what has happened? And we do technical support and a faculty member had called us and said, and I can't remember exactly, so please bear with me. But their points weren't out of what they thought it was. And when we check it was because they had not changed the one point to the 20 points that they need it. Therefore, it was based on something different, but they were trying to give additional points for extra credit and it would work because it was only showing the one-point hope that that helped her did I'm muddy the waters with that one. Well, like if so, therefore, we have to enter for each question the number of points. It should be for that question and we can't just put it into total and have it distributed automatically. Oh, I see what you're saying. No, I don't believe so. I've never done that. You have to do do it at the start, where we start to build out at the very beginning where I showed you that's where you put in the points. You can go back and get it. But if you left it at one isn't going to just automatically know. Okay. So you, if you realize after you've built out the quiz types are everything and then you realize, wait a minute, it's not calculating. You can go back and edit and change those, but it's not going to automatically do like a distribution range. Okay? The other question I had is, we have a professor always those multiple choice questions and he always had, has five answers. There's no way to set it up so that there's five, like blank spaces already. Because, because what I have to do is click Plus and then it creates another answer. But I didn't think there was any way to by default set how many answers there are for each question. Before you said, I don't believe though, because I think if you create a multiple choice, you get, I think it's at four. It automatically sets up for blinks. You're talking about multiple choice, so let's just do it really, really quick. Okay? So here's my multiple choice. So Scott, I think what Matthew is asking and I just want to be clear. This is a different type. This is a classic one, but he's saying, if you have multiple choice, question goes here and you're saying that you want. So it looks like you automatically get four blanks for the answers. I didn't know, but only way to change that but probably not. We can always add here if knee it. Okay. Yeah. You can always add if you're asking if there's a global default for that setting, I don't believe so, but when we go into Settings, I can ship but I've never seen that. I've never seen it. You can get it here or you can however you need to. Okay? Since we are here, FYI Scott as well, you can shuffle the choices here. Now, I don't know why it doesn't say shuffle questions as opposed to shovel choices because it's pretty much the same thing. And again, you can make a global change on that as I had said before. So I'm not going to keep this question because I wanted it out of 20 point, so I'm just going to kind of trash that and remove the question. Okay? So now we're done with the tooth, the categorization, and the matching so far. Any other questions, Scott, are you okay? Perfect. Thank you. Thanks for the thumbs up. Alright. So now we're going to continue on. So in essence of time I'm going to keep going. And now we're going to go into ordering. Okay, Scroll down here. So for ordering, again, same type. You don't have to put anything here. And I can say put these in order of, I don't know, year. And it can have a top label, say year. I'm 30 meter. And maybe an ending year. And we can say 1980 to 1965, 1,970.19, 1999. Okay. And again, remember how I said each one has something a little bit different, which you'll see, Oh, sorry, if I click away from that, my mouse and I are having a battle. So I'm gonna go back into edit again. I did not mean to edit out of that. So what you'll see down here, you can display answers in a paragraph. And when I first saw this and what does that mean, I'm just going to show you the differences so you'll know what the differences look like. It's really just layout. You can also include or not include the labels. So I'm going to select Done, and then I'm going to preview this so you can see what it looks like. You have to scroll up to the top to preview it. So if you're building out long questions, It's hard to see it, but if you click preview. Apologies for here we go. So you see how it looks now. And I can say put them in the order, then the student can either move it up by clicking on these dots or that they can hover over it as well. If you get this little symbol and you can drag and drop them in the orders as well. Does everybody see that? Again? You can actually click and say, move up, move down, or you can actually click and get the four-way arrow and you can move them in the orders as you wish. Now, I'm going to exit the preview and I'm going to go back to that same question so you can see what the difference is, is as far as that paragraph, you, so I'm going to go back into edit. And I'm going to say display answers in a paragraph form. And I'm going to preview it. So I'm going to scroll up again to preview. And now when you see it's just a design. It's just so design is linear as opposed to being an order. And then I can do this, and I can kinda move these accordingly. So it's very simplistic, but it depends on what you need it for and what may make the most sense. If I put starting here and ending here, year, starting here and ending year here, then the students can say, well, wait a minute, what does this mean? So you may not want the labels in this case. You may just want to label it says start from the beginning of the calendar year or however you need that. And then always exit your preview. Or because if you don't answer your preview, you can exit preview. Down here. It always gives you a banner that's even either if you're in your preview or your students student view as well. So you have that as an option. Okay. Any questions with that one? Okay. I always like to give a thoughtful pause. Let's go ahead and do one final one. And then we're going to get into some of the settings and some other things to the last one. Well, actually there's two. The last one, I want to show you stimulus and I'm saving hotspot for last. So stimulus. The stimulus question, this is the one that I said. You would have to create a passage for them to review. So I have one that's already built out actually in another course. And I'm going to ping pong over to this one. I'm going to go over this course. So I'm in another course because it's already built out for me so you can see it. And I can also grab the passage from there. Which one? I guess? This one, I think this is one of these already has a nice passage in it that I can just grab and plug in. Go to my dashboard. I think there was one down here. I just don't like to reinvent the wheel so I can grab one of these templates from it. I think this is it and practice a new quiz. There should be a passage in here I can just grab. If not, I can just grab one from something else. This is not the one I think. My apologies. I want to be thorough and make sure you see this beginning to end. Here's one that has a passage in here. Here we go. So I'm just going to take this sheeting. Yes, I am. Let's see. Can I just have submitted already? Oh, I can't just copy this. Yes, I can. Here we go. I just want to copy this over. All right, so going back to the stimulus question. So I'm gonna put a title for this. We're just going to call it michigan. Notice how it's optional to put instructions. And you're probably wondering, how is it optional to put instructions? How would the students know what to do? Well, that is because the stimulus is only the passage or the reading. You're building the questions from what's called the stimulus. So I'm just going to dump in what I hit copied here. Okay. Then you have some options that say, read the questions to the right, or you can click down and say, read the questions below. I'm just going to say questions to the right, which means over on this right-hand side that you see that's blink, you're going to build up the questions on that side. So I'm just going to select Done. And you'll see scroll down that there's the passage, but there's no questions. You have to attach a question. So you have to get the passage or the reading that you want. And then after you have that, then on the right-hand side, you attach the question. Hi, Pamela, how are you? I'm good. Sorry that I had to join late after another meeting. Thank you for allowing me to note. That's okay. We have about a half-hour left, but you are always welcome. So the stimulus is on the left-hand side, and then you attach your questions on the right-hand side. So if I click attach question, notice you're not limited to any specific question. You can attach anything except another stimulus question. It notice how that's not on the list anymore. So let's just keep it simple. I'm just going to click a true and false, let's say. And you can, again, there's nothing that needs to be here, but you do have to put something here, which is a question. And I can say Michigan is in the in the South. I don't know. Just making this up. So you have an option there. That's the question. And is that true or is that false? So I'm going to select false because that's the true answer. If you left it on true, the students that selected true, we get this correct. So you wanna make sure that it's set to false because it is false. You still have those same options that you've seen before with the on-screen calculator, the aligning outcomes, the item banks, and so on. Now notice you have points again. Remember I said I wanted this to be out of 100 points. The first two questions or three questions? Well, two questions. See, I made a mistake right here. See how I loved that at one point. I can always go back and edit. And that's why I said I always seem to make that change and the point system. But because this is a stemless question, I can have multiple questions here. So let's say I do want to make this into ten points. My points may not add up in the end, but you'll see exactly what I mean by that. If I select done that one question in the stimulus question is worth ten points. But I can add another question. Again. It's another question based on the passage off to the left-hand side. So it's not a different question. It has to relate to the passage. I can go ahead and I can do I don't know if fill-in-the-blank, then I can say Add a question here. What is the meaning of the word? I want to make sure I spelled it correctly. And then I can have this be worth ten points and forgot to put something. You must have a blank. Oh, this is one of the ones that you have to hit enter and get a blink. This is kind of different. It's not going to let me do it. Let me change this quickly. Every time I do this one, I always say I'm not going to use this. Sorry about this. I'm just gonna go ahead and trash this one. I'm sorry. Because I don't want to be mindful of our time here. Okay, so I'm gonna do ordering again, say attach that question, just do something really quick. It should relate to this passage. So again, match the state with the body of water. No, I'm not reading this whole thing. I cannot know what it says, but I'm just going to say Michigan, Lake Erie, and so on and so forth. You can add those as you go. Again, if you don't need them, you can delete these here. You can have a label as I showed you just a second ago. You can have your labels and you can decide to include the labels or in that display that I just showed you earlier. So for essence of time, I guess I'll make this ten points as well. So OK, select Done. Now I can't leave those blank. Sorry. I just don't have I don't want it to take time, You know, all the lakes. And we'll select Done. So the stimulus question itself, notice that the stimulus question, if you had ten points here, ten points there, it doesn't have the points underneath or off to the side as it did with ordering. You see how it has the one-point. Because you can build out several questions on this one reading that you have. You can continue to build all different types. Again, in the first previous showed you when we first started, I think there was three of them and they can be all different types. But it has to relate back to this. When you click on this blue plus at the bottom of your screen, that's going to take you to build yet another question types. So you'll be leaving the stimulus. Now, go back and make an edit before I forget this ordering, I said one point. So if you make mistakes, you can just click the little pencil. I think at the time it was doing 20. So I'm going to change this instead of 21 point to 20. Again, I don't know if my numbers at this point we'll be adding up, but I can always check later. Okay, So that is how you save that hold on 20 and done. My computer is running very slow. If you can tell I can tell on my end, I don't know if you can tell when you're in. Alright, so we have one more new question type that I want to get to. And then we're gonna get into some of the settings and moderation tabs. So I'm going to go ahead and click Add Content one last time, and we're going to click on something called hotspot. Now, hotspot, I will say, are, hotspots are not assessable. That's the caveat to this type of question. Hotspots are not assessable, they're nice to use. But you'll see that there's limitations to hotspots. What a hotspot as I described earlier, was, you can take an image and you can click on a particular area that you want the students to click on. But this is not assessable for screen readers and actually it says it right here. This question type is not assessable. I always like to highlight that for you because I'm one of the leaders of accessibility on our team. And even though I'm kinda torn, I want to show it, but you just want to be mindful that it is not assessable just to screen readers. So you can add your question type what you want them to do. So I'm going to say click on the portion of the picture that has a person in it. So you can drag or drop or actually browse for a picture that you want to drag into your screen. So I'm going to choose Martin Luther King. And this is where you want to be very careful to, because I said click on the picture that has a person in it. So if I just click on his face, well technically his arm and all, this is a part of Martin Luther King. So therefore, if you're going to ask the students to click on something specific, you want to make sure all areas have been selected and highlighted. Now for hotspot, you can use either a square or a circle or a polygon. Any one of these options would work depending upon what you're doing. I'm going to choose for this an oval. And then you want to be mindful, like I said, if you're going to have the students, you can just click, hold and drag, click, hold and drag. And you see how I'm leaving some fingers out. So technically, I probably want to move that over a little bit but see if a student clicks up here, it's gonna be marked incorrect. So be very mindful that I can say, well maybe a square might be the best way to capture more. And in this case it might be. And I can drag down and say Now that is better. Most times the student is going to click in that area. Alright? And I'm just going to click Done. And it says, the clicker, you have to click within the hotspot to receive full points. It tells you that like with all the other questions, I'm going to preview what this looks like now when you preview a hotspot, gonna go right up to the top. When you preview a hotspot, you're not necessarily going to see what you've selected. You're just going to see the picture. So you're not gonna know what you selected. So before previewing, unlike the others, you want to make sure everything is selected correctly. And that you've said that you have to click the entire portion of that image as well. So these are the question types that we've added. And you see I'm able to preview, it looks good. I can exit preview in the bottom right-hand corner of my screen. Okay, so those are the question types that I want it to go over with you. The categorization, we talked about matching. That is not a new question type. We just talked about it. We have the ordering, the stimulus and then the hotspot. And again, this is when we build out. That's why in this screen you can see what's been selected, but you're not actually previewing is if you were a student, you're just looking at it as you've created it. Are there any questions before I move into the last 20 min of our class? None here. Thank you, Pam. Alright, so we're gonna go back. So you've built out this quiz. We have few. Again, I would always check and make sure you preview it. And with me, like I said, points, I always forget those points. So right now I've got my point set looks like 60 points so far, 70, 80 points. And then I gave this 11. So I've got room for what? 20 points here. So I can go make that edit. Edit is your friend and always is for me as mini quizzes and things that I've filled out. I always seem to forget this part or always have to make adjustments. So I'm going to select Done and see. Alright, so now you've built out your quizzes. But there's another component that's really important and that's your settings. So these, after your quizzes built,\n",
      "INFO:root:Query to generate question for Topic - Quiz Points Configuration Guidance: For the topic: Quiz Points Configuration Guidance, generate a multiple choice type question based on the following transcribed text: I'm going to take a thoughtful pause.

So now we're going to continue on. So in essence of time I'm going to keep going. And now we're going to go into ordering. Okay, Scroll down here. So for ordering, again, same type. You don't have to put anything here. And I can say put these in order of, I don't know, year. And it can have a top label, say year. I'm 30 meter. And maybe an ending year. And we can say 1980 to 1965, 1,970.19, 1999. Okay. And again, remember how I said each one has something a little bit different, which you'll see, Oh, sorry, if I click away from that, my mouse and I are having a battle. So I'm gonna go back into edit again. I did not mean to edit out of that. So what you'll see down here, you can display answers in a paragraph. And when I first saw this and what does that mean, I'm just going to show you the differences so you'll know what the differences look like. It's really just layout. You can also include or not include the labels. So I'm going to select Done, and then I'm going to preview this so you can see what it looks like. You have to scroll up to the top to preview it.

It's just so design is linear as opposed to being an order. And then I can do this, and I can kinda move these accordingly. So it's very simplistic, but it depends on what you need it for and what may make the most sense. If I put starting here and ending here, year, starting here and ending year here, then the students can say, well, wait a minute, what does this mean? So you may not want the labels in this case. You may just want to label it says start from the beginning of the calendar year or however you need that. And then always exit your preview. Or because if you don't answer your preview, you can exit preview. Down here. It always gives you a banner that's even either if you're in your preview or your students student view as well. So you have that as an option. Okay. Any questions with that one? Okay. I always like to give a thoughtful pause. Let's go ahead and do one final one. And then we're going to get into some of the settings and some other things to the last one. Well, actually there's two. The last one, I want to show you stimulus and I'm saving hotspot for last. So stimulus. The stimulus question, this is the one that I said. You would have to create a passage for them to review. So I have one that's already built out actually in another course. And I'm going to ping pong over to this one. I'm going to go over this course. So I'm in another course because it's already built out for me so you can see it. And I can also grab the passage from there. Which one? I guess? This one, I think this is one of these already has a nice passage in it that I can just grab and plug in. Go to my dashboard. I think there was one down here. I just don't like to reinvent the wheel so I can grab one of these templates from it. I think this is it and practice a new quiz. There should be a passage in here I can just grab. If not, I can just grab one from something else. This is not the one I think. My apologies. I want to be thorough and make sure you see this beginning to end. Here's one that has a passage in here. Here we go. So I'm just going to take this sheeting. Yes, I am. Let's see. Can I just have submitted already? Oh, I can't just copy this. Yes, I can. Here we go. I just want to copy this over. All right, so going back to the stimulus question. So I'm gonna put a title for this. We're just going to call it michigan. Notice how it's optional to put instructions. And you're probably wondering, how is it optional to put instructions? How would the students know what to do? Well, that is because the stimulus is only the passage or the reading. You're building the questions from what's called the stimulus. So I'm just going to dump in what I hit copied here. Okay. Then you have some options that say, read the questions to the right, or you can click down and say, read the questions below. I'm just going to say questions to the right, which means over on this right-hand side that you see that's blink, you're going to build up the questions on that side. So I'm just going to select Done. And you'll see scroll down that there's the passage, but there's no questions. You have to attach a question. So you have to get the passage or the reading that you want. And then after you have that, then on the right-hand side, you attach the question. Hi, Pamela, how are you? I'm good. Sorry that I had to join late after another meeting. Thank you for allowing me to note. That's okay. We have about a half-hour left, but you are always welcome. So the stimulus is on the left-hand side, and then you attach your questions on the right-hand side. So if I click attach question, notice you're not limited to any specific question. You can attach anything except another stimulus question. It notice how that's not on the list anymore. So let's just keep it simple. I'm just going to click a true and false, let's say. And you can, again, there's nothing that needs to be here, but you do have to put something here, which is a question. And I can say Michigan is in the in the South. I don't know. Just making this up. So you have an option there. That's the question. And is that true or is that false? So I'm going to select false because that's the true answer. If you left it on true, the students that selected true, we get this correct. So you wanna make sure that it's set to false because it is false. You still have those same options that you've seen before with the on-screen calculator, the aligning outcomes, the item banks, and so on. Now notice you have points again. Remember I said I wanted this to be out of 100 points. The first two questions or three questions? Well, two questions. See, I made a mistake right here. See how I loved that at one point. I can always go back and edit. And that's why I said I always seem to make that change and the point system. But because this is a stemless question, I can have multiple questions here. So let's say I do want to make this into ten points. My points may not add up in the end, but you'll see exactly what I mean by that. If I select done that one question in the stimulus question is worth ten points. But I can add another question. Again. It's another question based on the passage off to the left-hand side. So it's not a different question. It has to relate to the passage. I can go ahead and I can do I don't know if fill-in-the-blank, then I can say Add a question here. What is the meaning of the word? I want to make sure I spelled it correctly. And then I can have this be worth ten points and forgot to put something. You must have a blank. Oh, this is one of the ones that you have to hit enter and get a blink. This is kind of different. It's not going to let me do it. Let me change this quickly. Every time I do this one, I always say I'm not going to use this. Sorry about this. I'm just gonna go ahead and trash this one. I'm sorry. Because I don't want to be mindful of our time here. Okay, so I'm gonna do ordering again, say attach that question, just do something really quick. It should relate to this passage. So again, match the state with the body of water. No, I'm not reading this whole thing. I cannot know what it says, but I'm just going to say Michigan, Lake Erie, and so on and so forth. You can add those as you go. Again, if you don't need them, you can delete these here. You can have a label as I showed you just a second ago. You can have your labels and you can decide to include the labels or in that display that I just showed you earlier. So for essence of time, I guess I'll make this ten points as well. So OK, select Done. Now I can't leave those blank. Sorry. I just don't have I don't want it to take time, You know, all the lakes. And we'll select Done. So the stimulus question itself, notice that the stimulus question, if you had ten points here, ten points there, it doesn't have the points underneath or off to the side as it did with ordering. You see how it has the one-point. Because you can build out several questions on this one reading that you have. You can continue to build all different types. Again, in the first previous showed you when we first started, I think there was three of them and they can be all different types. But it has to relate back to this. When you click on this blue plus at the bottom of your screen, that's going to take you to build yet another question types. So you'll be leaving the stimulus. Now, go back and make an edit before I forget this ordering, I said one point. So if you make mistakes, you can just click the little pencil. I think at the time it was doing 20. So I'm going to change this instead of 21 point to 20. Again, I don't know if my numbers at this point we'll be adding up, but I can always check later. Okay, So that is how you save that hold on 20 and done. My computer is running very slow. If you can tell I can tell on my end, I don't know if you can tell when you're in. Alright, so we have one more new question type that I want to get to. And then we're gonna get into some of the settings and moderation tabs. So I'm going to go ahead and click Add Content one last time, and we're going to click on something called hotspot. Now, hotspot, I will say, are, hotspots are not assessable. That's the caveat to this type of question. Hotspots are not assessable, they're nice to use. But you'll see that there's limitations to hotspots. What a hotspot as I described earlier, was, you can take an image and you can click on a particular area that you want the students to click on. But this is not assessable for screen readers and actually it says it right here. This question type is not assessable. I always like to highlight that for you because I'm one of the leaders of accessibility on our team. And even though I'm kinda torn, I want to show it, but you just want to be mindful that it is not assessable just to screen readers. So you can add your question type what you want them to do. So I'm going to say click on the portion of the picture that has a person in it. So you can drag or drop or actually browse for a picture that you want to drag into your screen. So I'm going to choose Martin Luther King. And this is where you want to be very careful to, because I said click on the picture that has a person in it. So if I just click on his face, well technically his arm and all, this is a part of Martin Luther King. So therefore, if you're going to ask the students to click on something specific, you want to make sure all areas have been selected and highlighted. Now for hotspot, you can use either a square or a circle or a polygon. Any one of these options would work depending upon what you're doing. I'm going to choose for this an oval. And then you want to be mindful, like I said, if you're going to have the students, you can just click, hold and drag, click, hold and drag. And you see how I'm leaving some fingers out. So technically, I probably want to move that over a little bit but see if a student clicks up here, it's gonna be marked incorrect. So be very mindful that I can say, well maybe a square might be the best way to capture more. And in this case it might be. And I can drag down and say Now that is better. Most times the student is going to click in that area. Alright? And I'm just going to click Done. And it says, the clicker, you have to click within the hotspot to receive full points. It tells you that like with all the other questions, I'm going to preview what this looks like now when you preview a hotspot, gonna go right up to the top. When you preview a hotspot, you're not necessarily going to see what you've selected. You're just going to see the picture. So you're not gonna know what you selected. So before previewing, unlike the others, you want to make sure everything is selected correctly. And that you've said that you have to click the entire portion of that image as well. So these are the question types that we've added. And you see I'm able to preview, it looks good. I can exit preview in the bottom right-hand corner of my screen. Okay, so those are the question types that I want it to go over with you. The categorization, we talked about matching. That is not a new question type. We just talked about it. We have the ordering, the stimulus and then the hotspot. And again, this is when we build out. That's why in this screen you can see what's been selected, but you're not actually previewing is if you were a student, you're just looking at it as you've created it. Are there any questions before I move into the last 20 min of our class? None here. Thank you, Pam. Alright, so we're gonna go back. So you've built out this quiz. We have few. Again, I would always check and make sure you preview it. And with me, like I said, points, I always forget those points. So right now I've got my point set looks like 60 points so far, 70, 80 points. And then I gave this 11. So I've got room for what? 20 points here. So I can go make that edit. Edit is your friend and always is for me as mini quizzes and things that I've filled out. I always seem to forget this part or always have to make adjustments. So I'm going to select Done and see. Alright, so now you've built out your quizzes. But there's another component that's really important and that's your settings. So these, after your quizzes built,\n",
      "There should be four possible answers, with one being the correct answers. Also Provide a short reason to why each answer is correct or incorrect.\n",
      "Return the data in the following JSON format as an example: {\"question\": \"What is the capital of France?\", \"answers\": [\"Paris\", \"London\", \"Berlin\", \"Madrid\"], \"correct\": \"Paris\", \"reason\": \"Paris is the capital of France\"}\n",

      "INFO:root:Relevant text selected for Topic - Student Accommodations Management: Alright. Okay. So we're gonna go on to moderate. This section is highly important. So let's say you have some students, I have some students here. And they want what's called accommodations. Accommodations. If you're not aware of, is not for a student that says, Hey, I am just want you to give me some extra time because I didn't do well on a test. There's two areas where accommodations can be set into reasons for it. There could be a reason where it's an ongoing accommodation and what that usually means that a student needs support, whether it's because I'm usually coming from the Students Services area because they use screen readers or they actually have to have additional time when they're taking tests. That's something that could be set one time in one time only on that student. Usually it's because of a recommendation. Like I said, they're using a screen reader or there's something that they need assistance with any need some additional time built into that quiz. There's other scenarios which I'll show you over here. It may be a one-off, a onetime internet goes down. The dog is chewing it someone's leg. I don't know. And you need that onetime for that one quiz for that one person. But there's differences between the two. So let's start with, let's say you have a student, you have a search box here. So let's say you have a long list. I don't have a long list obviously, but let's say I want to search for a student, a, if I put in student and I start typing a 0, that's the student that I want to add some time to. Looks like I've already done. So. If I click on this little pencil under accommodations, again, it will be applied to all courses that a student needs. Extra time for. The student says, I need to get at least a time or time and a half. I can remove time if at some point the student does not need that. But usually when you're in accommodations, the student is going to need it for more than a one-off situation. And you can choose none, give additional time, remove it, or time multiplier. So when I select this, I can add in. Usually I don't have like 0.14. I usually due to time or time and a half or 0.5. Here I said 1.5 times multiplier of whatever the test is. In most cases you may just need one. If I click Save, and again, this is going to be determined by you and the student. And maybe if they have a students services, they get something in writing. You can apply this. You would have to go in and apply this. It's not going to happen automatically. And you don't want to apply it for all students in a class, for all situations. So I'm going to be very clear of that. So I'm going to take out the search because I want to see all my students now. I can also see all my instructors as well. So let's say that student B comes to you. My internet service went out. Can I get time to retake the test? And can I have some sort of accommodation with that one test, that one time. You'll see that you can say add additional attempts here. So I'm going to say one additional tip. Then I can set the time here, give additional time. Or I can say Remove time. Well, if we're in this area, I'm going to say give additional time and then I can select not necessarily a multiplier, but I can say, okay, your internet went out. I'll give you just 15 extra minutes if you can't get it done in 15 extra minutes, well, you can always change that, but that's a discussion you would need to know prior to this student taking a quiz. You hope if you don't know, you can come in afterwards. Like I said, the internet went out. They had no way of knowing that. And you can adjust the time as needed and you'll see it's automatically adjusted here. Now, want to show you something now that you can do just because this student gets additional time. And you notice, again, when I click on the pencil, it always tells you this. It always let you know that this is the setting that's applied to all courses. But let's say this person on top of that needs an extra 15 min. You can set that as well. So I can say one attempt, maybe an additional tab. And I can do 15 min here. So you'll see that it's going to be applied. You have that plus an additional 15 min. That's how that's read. So again, you want to be very mindful of how to set those. I'm gonna go back to my presentation, but any questions on that piece before I return? Just one question. In the classic quizzes, you couldn't access the moderation before the quiz is published. Is that still true in New Quizzes? Here you can see the quiz is not published. You can still access the moderate range because I have not technically over here, I haven't actually built this out and it's here, but I don't believe I've published it, so okay. Let's hear yeah. Okay. I'm looking at my time. I'm sorry. I'm back to my slides. I've already went through these. Fyi, Pam. I will be, we are recording and we will be sending out these slides and then we're also going to be published. So these are some of the ones I went over. I went over a couple of others in addition as well. So one thing I want to point your attention to is that we have, we built a new quizzes model in Canvas. This is for faculty or staff to take this as if they were students. So it's built out so that you can play around with new quizzes. I'm going to just click. Quick so you can see what that looks like. So it is a course that you can actually take so that you can get a field in actual feel for it. So I'm going to click on New Quizzes Engine module, so you can see this. And over here it says New Quizzes topics. You can click on the topics. You can actually again take this as if you were students so you can kind of get a feeling how the new quizzes respond, how you can play with the settings, the moderation edits, all of that. So in order to get access, and again, I can put this in the chat, but this is how you would sign to get, and it's actually at the bottom of this force in settings as well. But of course you're not going to get there, so I can send this to you. And it's going to also be here right in the presentation. So if you want that, you can kind of play around with them. Another update that we have is on our website. On our website, it's ever changing. I'm a multitasker. I update some of the websites. I'm a trainer, I do change management a lot of things, but one thing I really, really tried to do is keep us updated with all of the releases that come out from Instructure. And sometimes that's difficult because like with any other software or LMS specifically, others updates constantly. So on our site officially as starting this week, we will be seeing updates and new releases. Now that being said, there's another way you can see them, but we pulled out some of the releases that it would help for faculty and staff specifically. But if you go into a course and I'm just going to pop into this course here. I'm gonna go into my course. Just click on the one I was in today. And if you go to settings down here at the bottom, click on it. I swear I did. The settings. You will see that. I'm not sure if everyone is aware of or not, but you see sections, navigation, apps, feature options, and integrations. If there's any new features, sometimes, sometimes there'll be listed here. If you go to help. If you go to help over here, you'll see release notes or release updates. I'm not sure if you knew about this as well, but this is I talked about this in our class second ago. Remember, these are some of the release notes that you'll see under help. But we make it a little bit easier because there's so many of these you will become overwhelmed. So if you go to our website, we pull out the ones that are more specific to instructors that are probably need it if you want to, you'll see this list is never ending practically. There's more than that. So under Help, yes, you do have how to get to Canvas and for help, but you also have your release notes here underneath the help. So there's a lot of different ways to get help. So we encourage you to do so. But this again, this page just launched. We make updates usually once a month to that page. And here are some of the resources that we have, our project site and our canvas, additional trainings. We're going to hold some more trainings to the beginning of the year. So stay tuned for those. I'm going to stop the recording. And I'm going to stop the recording to see if you have any questions.\n",
      "INFO:root:Query to generate question for Topic - Student Accommodations Management: For the topic: Student Accommodations Management, generate a multiple choice type question based on the following transcribed text: Alright. Okay. So we're gonna go on to moderate. This section is highly important. So let's say you have some students, I have some students here. And they want what's called accommodations. Accommodations.

# Overall Summary of QuestionBot Project

## Brief Description of Project

This ReadMe files aims to be a common reference document to all other links and sources that are linked to the annoto-gai (QuestionBot) project, a Summer '24 Intern project built at U-M ITS Teaching and Learning.

The overall goal of this project was to generate questions that can be inserted into a video to test viewer understanding of the video's content as they watch it. This is done by taking the .srt transcript file from a video, and using the script (usage explained in a separate ReadMe) to generate Question data. A tool called Annoto could be implemented in the future to grab this data and insert the questions into a video.
